Great! I’ll search for an open-source, multi-tiered microservices project that is moderately complex—more realistic than a basic 2-tier app, but less overwhelming than something like the OpenTelemetry Demo. It should come with Dockerfiles and optionally Kubernetes YAMLs to serve as guidance. I'll prioritize projects from domains like e-commerce, fintech, or booking systems and focus on ones suitable for Kubernetes practice and eventual deployment on AWS EKS with Terraform. I’ll report back shortly with a few solid options.

# Open-Source Microservices Demo Projects

There are several open-source “reference” applications that provide multi-tier microservices architectures out-of-the-box. For example, **Google’s Online Boutique (a.k.a. Hipster Shop)** is a 10-service e‑commerce demo where each backend is written in a different language (Go, Node.js, Java, C#, Python) and they communicate over gRPC. This demo includes a web frontend plus nine backend services (cart, product catalog, currency, payment, shipping, email, checkout, recommendation, ad). It comes with Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests/Helm charts to deploy it on Kubernetes (GKE or local clusters) with minimal setup.

The app is purposely **multi-service** and cloud-native, so you can practice building/deploying each service separately on Kubernetes. (It is fairly complex, so many learners start with it and then trim services if needed.)

Another widely-used demo is **Weaveworks’ Sock Shop**. Sock Shop is an online “sock store” implemented as _eight_ microservices (front-end, orders, payment, user, catalog, cart, shipping, queue) written in Spring Boot (Java), Go kit, and Node.js. It’s explicitly designed for microservices practice – the code repo includes Dockerfiles for each service and Kubernetes YAML/Helm deployment scripts. Sock Shop runs as Docker containers by default and was originally used to demo Weave Net/Kubernetes in workshops.

Cisco’s **MartianBank** is another good mid-sized example (6 backend services + UI). MartianBank simulates a banking app: the React UI and NGINX reverse proxy sit in front of six microservices (customer-auth, atm-locator in Node.js; accounts, transactions, loans, dashboard in Python/Flask). All components are Dockerized and the project provides Helm charts and Docker Compose for easy deployment. For example, the MartianBank README notes _“There are 6 microservices… 2 (customer-auth and atm-locator) are Node.js whereas the others are Flask (Python)”_. (An architecture diagram is shown below.) These services communicate via HTTP or gRPC, and the repo even highlights “Helm-based configurable deployments” and easy install on Docker/Kubernetes/Kind/EKS.

Finally, Microsoft’s **eShop Reference Application** (formerly _eShopOnContainers_, now moved to [dotnet/eShop](https://github.com/dotnet/eShop)) is a .NET/C# sample e-commerce site built on microservices. It was explicitly designed to showcase Docker and Kubernetes: the README says it’s a cross-platform .NET 7 demo running in Docker containers on Kubernetes. (For example: “Cross-platform .NET sample microservices… Powered by .NET 7, Docker Containers and Azure Kubernetes Services”.) The eShop repo includes Docker Compose, Kubernetes manifests, and even Helm support. In practice it deploys several .NET core backend services and a web frontend, all containerized, providing another rich multi-service stack for K8s practice.

Each of these projects is freely available on GitHub under open-source licenses. They come with **Dockerfiles** for each service and **Kubernetes/Helm deployment files**, so you don’t have to write everything from scratch. You can clone any one of them, build the Docker images, and start deploying to your cluster. They strike a balance between simplicity and scale (more complex than a basic 2-tier app but not overwhelmingly large) and are ideal for practicing containerization, service discovery, config management (env vars), and monitoring on Kubernetes.
